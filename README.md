# RayTracer
Project made by me and two other colleagues with various graphics features (with visual debug as well) which can be manually enabled/disabled (some features might not work without others). The features present in the project are:
1) Shading (using Phong Illumination model)
2) Recursive ray-tracer (reflection and shadow rays)
3) Hard shadows
4) Area lights
5) Acceleration data-structure generation and traversal (bounding volume hierarchy)
6) Normal interpolation with barycentric coordinates
7) Texture mapping
8) Environment maps
9) SAH (binning as splitting criterion for BVH)
10) Motion blur
11) Texture filtering: bilinear interpolation
12) Texture filtering: mipmaps
13) Cast multiple rays per pixel with irregular sampling
14) Glossy reflections
15) Transparency
16) Depth of field
